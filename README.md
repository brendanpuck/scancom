# scancom
Scancom is a node.js app that uses the node-serialport
(https://github.com/voodootikigod/node-serialport) package to send commands
to a device from a terminal prompt.

I created it to send commands to a scanning receiver (AOR AR-NV1) in order to
test the various functions. I could have used something like minicom but that
wouldn't be quite as fun ;)

Improvements or suggestions appreciated.
